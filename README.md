ENPH 353 Lab 03 - ROS simulation

Objectives: Understand how to launch basic ROS systems, learn how to create simulated worlds, learn how to create simulated robots, and develop a controller for a simulated robot using its camera feed.

Tasks: Setup a ROS workspace and clone ENPH353 lab, create a simple simulated track for line following, launch a ROS system, create a simulated robot, and develop a line following robot using computer vision.
